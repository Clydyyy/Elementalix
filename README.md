Elementalix is an augmented reality mobile learning application designed to improve the study experience of the Periodic Table of Elements. It provides a 360° realistic view and comprehensive information on all 118 elements and their compounds.

The system is designed for high school students and teachers to enhance the quality of chemistry education, specifically focusing on the Periodic Table of Elements, using Augmented Reality (AR) technology. This game-based AR application allows users to visualize the periodic table through interactive cards, explore the formation of simple compounds by placing elements next to each other, and gain fundamental knowledge about the elements through dedicated learning portals with cards and quizzes. This approach benefits students, science faculty members, and the school by providing a more convenient and engaging learning experience compared to traditional methods.
